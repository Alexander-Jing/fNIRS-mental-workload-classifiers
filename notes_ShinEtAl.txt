We did not assess in detail how well and accurately the participant performed the given task inter-participant variability of the task performance cannot be well studied using this dataset

Classification procedures were conducted on EEG datasets A-C and NIRS dataset C. For datasets A and B, ‘target’ versus ‘non-target’ ERP classification was solely conducted, while for dataset C, WG versus BL EEG-NIRS meta-classification was conducted [ref 26]. Since the sampling rate of NIRS data was not enough to distinguish a task-induced fast response, such as ERP, the fast NIRS response of datasets A and B was not considered in this study. This is the reason why EEG-NIRS meta-classification was performed only for dataset C

A limit of all datasets available is the time constraint within every experiment and the desire to study a variety of paradigms. Thus, typically the rest periods for the NIRS data are not long enough to let the response return to the baseline level. We used an ISI of 1.5 s for n-back (dataset A) and DSR (dataset B) tasks. Considering that the peak hemodynamic responses can be observed about 6 s after a stimulus is presented [ref 61], the n-back and DSR dataset measured with the short ISI is not appropriate for event-related NIRS analysis
